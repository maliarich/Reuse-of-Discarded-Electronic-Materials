# OER for Reuse of Discarded Electronic Materials
**(DIY Power Bank, variable voltage regulator, eco-friendly Lamp, LED Disco Light)**

## Description
Reusing Electronics Materials is crutial in the context of a Refugee Settlement and helps understanding electronic components.
Reuse refers to the act of finding new uses for items or materials that would otherwise go to waste, various DIY projects can showcase the concept of reuse, encouraging learners to think creatively and resourcefully. Here are some Projects from E- waste: -



 ## Learning Objective 
### 1. DIY power bank.
By repurposing old lamps  batteries or salvaging usable components from discarded electronics, learners can create a portable power source for charging their devices. This project not only reduces waste but also promotes self-sufficiency and innovation.

[**Instructions Guide for DIY Power Bank**](DIY-Power-Bank.md).

### 2. Variable DC voltage regulator
Instead of purchasing expensive regulators, learners can repurpose components from old electrical devices to build one themselves. This not only saves money but also reduces the demand for new electronics, contributing to a more sustainable environment.

### 3/4. Eco-friendly Lamp and LED Disco Light 
By repurposing glass bottles, jars, or other containers, learners can create unique and aesthetically pleasing lighting fixtures. Moreover, using energy-efficient LED bulbs can further enhance the sustainability aspect, reducing energy consumption and promoting eco-conscious habits.

### 5. BC547 transistor and a push button

The BC547 is a general-purpose NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT) that can be used in a variety of electronic circuits. When used as a switch, it can control the flow of current between the collector and emitter terminals.

### 6. BC547, Buzzer and Relay.
when a Buzzer, BC547 transistor and relay are connected to gether it creates a project such as an alarm system where the relay is used to control the power supply to the buzzer, and the BC547 transistor is used to control the relay based on the input signal.

### 7. Photoresistor and BC547 ( Automatic Night Light)

This circuit works on the principal that electricity follows the path of lest resistance. 
1. When light is hitting the photoresistor its resistance is lower than that of the base of the transistor, therefore the "electricity" will bypass the transistor and flow through the photoresistor, following the least resistance to ground. 
2. When no light hits the photoresistor its resistance is higher than that of the transistors base and the electricity will flow into the base of the transistor activating it to turn on the LED.

### 8. Infrared Motion Detector with TIP32C

In this instructional guide, we will demonstrate how to build a simple DIY Infrared (IR) motion detector using commonly available electronic components.
1. The motion detector will utilize an IR sensor to detect motion and trigger an LED indicator. This project can be a fun and educational way to learn about basic electronics and sensor technology.
2. When motion is detected, the IR sensor will send a signal to the base of the TIP32C transistor, allowing current to flow through the LED and illuminate it.

### 9. Blinking-LED-circuit-using-Optocoupler

When the circuit is powered, the capacitor charges through the 1k ohm resistor.As the capacitor charges, the voltage across it increases.
Once the voltage across the capacitor reaches a certain threshold, the optocoupler triggers.
When the optocoupler triggers, it turns on the LED momentarily.After triggering, the capacitor discharges through the LED and the optocoupler.
The cycle then repeats, causing the LED to blink at a regular interval.

### 10. Automatic Irrigation System Prototype for Beginners 

Watering plants manually can be time-consuming and inefficient especially in places with long dry spell for instance in Rhino camp refugee settlement in Uganda. This DIY project guides Students  to build a low-cost automatic irrigation system using locally available materials from discarded waste and simple electronics.
The system uses a soil moisture sensor to detect when plants need water and a 12V DC pump to deliver water automatically. The project is mounted on a wooden base, with containers acting as the mini farm and water tank.
