This circuit works on the principal that electricity follows the path of lest resistance. 
1. When light is hitting the photoresistor its resistance is lower than that of the base of the transistor, therefore the "electricity" will bypass the transistor and flow through the photoresistor, following the least resistance to ground. 
2. When no light hits the photoresistor its resistance is higher than that of the transistors base and the electricity will flow into the base of the transistor activating it to turn on the LED.

### Materials Required for the project

### How the components are connected:

1. Connect the positive terminal of the power source (Vcc) to the collector of the BC547 transistor
2. From the collector terminal ,connect the 4k resistor to the base of the BC547 transistor 
3. From the base  of the BC547,connect the photoresistor and join the other terminal with the ground of the LED 
4. Connect the ground of the power source to the ground  of the LED .
5. Connect the Emitter of the BC547 to a 220 0hms resistor 
6. From the other terminal of the 220 ohms,connect the postive terminal of the LED
7. Test the prototype.
