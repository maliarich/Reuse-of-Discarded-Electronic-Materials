 ## Introduction
 
Watering plants manually can be time-consuming and inefficient especially in places with long dry spell for instance in Rhino camp refugee settlement in Uganda. This DIY project guides Students  to build a low-cost automatic irrigation system using locally available materials from discarded waste and simple electronics.
The system uses a soil moisture sensor to detect when plants need water and a 12V DC pump to deliver water automatically. The project is mounted on a wooden base, with containers acting as the mini farm and water tank.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, learners will:

    1. Assemble basic electronic components into a functional project.
    2. Apply principles of sustainability and DIY innovation by reusing containers.
    3. Demonstrate safe handling of simple electronic tools and materials.

### Materials Needed

    • 1 wooden board – base for the project.
    • 2 × 9V batteries – one for the Arduino, one for the pump.
    • 2 switches – to control Arduino power and pump power.
    • Connecting wires – for electrical connections.
    • 1 plastic tray (cut from a jerrycan) – mini farm bed.
    • 1 plastic container – water tank.
    • 1 × 12V DC water pump – to pump water.
    • 1 × Soil Moisture Sensor – to detect soil dryness.
    • 1 × 12V Relay Module – to control pump switching.
    • 1 Arduino Uno (or similar) – brain of the system.
Optional: screws, glue, tape, soldering iron  for better mounting.
